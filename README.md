##*SimpleGE*##

(unfinished right now)

####*Description:*####
	this is a simple encapsulation of "Alpha Engine" which used to develop games;
	though I named this "SimpleGE", it can't be a real game engine right now, and I write SimpleGE just to improve my coding ability, maybe someday I'll write a real game engine :)

####*Alpha Engine:*####
	it's a shame that I can't find any document of "Alpha Engine", I use it only because I take a lesson called "Game Develop", and "Alpha Engine" is just used for teaching.
	Alpha Engine is written in C, and it can used to render triangles, to check keyboard input and so on.
	my work is encapsulation it by C++, and I took Cocos2d-x for reference, so when using SimpleGE, it looks like using Cocos2d-x sometimes XD.

####*About this Repo:*####
	in this repo, there's not only a "SimpleGE", but also a little game developped by "SimpleGE", it'll be look like "Pac Man".
	
####*PS:*####
	this so-called "SimpleGE" has huge distance to a real engine, so I'll be happy if someone who has some good advice to me, I'll try my best to develop it, thanks~
